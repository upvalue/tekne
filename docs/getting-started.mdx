### Getting Started

The best place to get started with Tekne right now is by reading the Tutorial document. 

If you missed it, you can use the "Restart Tutorial" command in the command palette
(`Cmd-Shift-K`) to start it again.

#### Editor

For help using the editor, check out the `Editor Syntax` and `Keyboard Shortcuts` help
articles.

#### Aggregate view

The aggregate view is automatically created when you tag data, and shows summaries of all
the data for the tag. For example, if you created a document like this:

```
- #tag
-   <successful task>
-   <30min timer>
```

The aggregate view would then show you how many tasks are complete, incomplete or have no
status, as well as the overall time spent on them.

The aggregate view is automatically generated based on the tags in the currently open document.

More control and features are coming soon.
